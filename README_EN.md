- ✅ **Cross-SIM Calling** - Dual-SIM interconnection
- ✅ **UT Supplementary Services** - Call forwarding, waiting, etc.
- ✅ **5G NR** (NSA/SA) - Enable 5G standalone/non-standalone networks

### System Requirements
- Google Pixel device (tested on Pixel 6+)
- Android 14 or higher
- [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) installed and running
- Shizuku permission granted to Turbo IMS

## 🚀 Installation

### Method 1: Download APK (Recommended)
1. Download the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/openwrt1/TurboIMS/releases)
2. Install the APK on your Pixel device
3. Grant necessary permissions

### Method 2: Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/openwrt1/TurboIMS.git
cd TurboIMS

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install to connected device
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Prerequisites Setup
1. **Install Shizuku**
   - Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku/releases) or Google Play
   - Start Shizuku service (via Wireless debugging or Root)

2. **Grant Permissions**
   - Open Turbo IMS
   - Grant Shizuku permission when prompted

### Configuring IMS Features

1. **Check System Status**
   - Verify Android version is displayed
   - Ensure Shizuku status shows "✅ Ready"

2. **Select SIM Card**
   - Tap "Select SIM Card" button
   - Choose SIM 1, SIM 2, or "Apply to All SIM Cards"

3. **Enable Features**
   - Toggle switches for desired IMS features
   - All features are enabled by default

4. **Apply Configuration**
   - Tap the blue "Apply Configuration" button
   - Wait 3 seconds for configuration to complete
   - App will automatically return to foreground
   - Choose "Go to Network Settings" to verify features

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3+ Users**
- Configuration is non-persistent on Android 16 Beta builds
- Settings will reset after reboot
- You must reapply configuration after each restart

✅ **Verifying Configuration**
- Go to Settings → Network & Internet → SIMs
- Check that VoLTE, VoWiFi options are visible
- Make a test call to verify functionality

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Privileged Process**: Uses Android Instrumentation to run with system privileges
- **Shizuku Integration**: Leverages Shizuku framework for privilege escalation
- **CarrierConfigManager**: Directly modifies carrier configuration bundles
- **Shell Permission Delegation**: Temporary NETWORK_SETTINGS permission

### Configuration Keys Modified
The app modifies the following carrier configuration keys:
- `KEY_CARRIER_VOLTE_AVAILABLE_BOOL`
- `KEY_CARRIER_VT_AVAILABLE_BOOL`
- `KEY_CARRIER_WFC_IMS_AVAILABLE_BOOL`
- `KEY_ENHANCED_4G_LTE_ON_BY_DEFAULT_BOOL`
- `KEY_EDITABLE_ENHANCED_4G_LTE_BOOL`
- `KEY_HIDE_ENHANCED_4G_LTE_BOOL`
- And many more... (see source code for complete list)

### Package Details
- **Package Name**: `io.github.turboims.pixel`
- **Min SDK**: Android 14 (API 34)
- **Target SDK**: Android 15 (API 35)
- **Version**: 3.0 (Build 5)

## ⚠️ Important Note (Fixing "Immediate Disconnect/Call Drop" when calling China Mobile)

If you experience immediate call drops (the call disconnects immediately during dialing or the first ring) when calling certain China Mobile numbers, please read the following explanation and instructions:

### Cause of the Issue
1. **Video Color Ringback Tone (VCRBT) Conflict**: China Mobile frequently enables a "Video Color Ringback Tone" service for many subscribers. When you dial these numbers, the network attempts to push a video stream during the early media stage (negotiation phase, SDP containing `m=video`).
2. **Baseband Parser Bug**: Google Pixel devices (Pixel 6, 7, 8, 9 series) utilize Samsung's **Shannon modem (baseband)**. When the baseband's internal IMS protocol stack attempts to parse the non-standard video SDP headers pushed by China Mobile, it triggers an internal parsing exception/crash. This drops the call instantly with the error code `1610 (CODE_REJECT_UNSUPPORTED_SDP_HEADERS)` or `TERMINATED_UNSUPPORTED_SDP_HEADERS`.
3. **Modem Firmware is Unmodifiable**: The cellular modem runs on a separate, closed-source real-time operating system (RTOS) which is completely isolated from Android. Third-party apps or custom ROMs cannot patch this firmware.

### Solution
To bypass this modem parser bug, we implement a system-level force-disable of Video Telephony (VT) in this app:
1. **Disable VT in App**: Keep the **"Video Telephony (VT)"** switch set to **Disabled** (we have set this as the default), then click **Apply Configuration**.
2. **System-wide Toggle**: The app will use Shizuku privileges to reflectively call the hidden system API `ImsMmTelManager.setVtSettingEnabled(false)` to force-disable the global video calling switch in Android.
3. **Bypass Logic**: When disabled, your device registers to IMS with no video capabilities. The China Mobile network, recognizing you cannot receive video, will **automatically downgrade the color ringback to a standard audio-only tone**. This prevents the network from sending `m=video` SDP packets, completely avoiding the modem parser bug and allowing calls to connect successfully.
4. **Carrier Entitlement (Alternative)**: If the call still drops, it means the network is still forcing the video stream. You should contact your carrier's customer service (e.g., dial **10000** for China Telecom) and request them to **"Deactivate Video Telephony (VT) service on my account"** (while keeping VoLTE voice active).
